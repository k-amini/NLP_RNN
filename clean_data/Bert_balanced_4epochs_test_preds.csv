our company has offers sophisticated “done for you” marketing technology and services to solo practitioner lawyers and boutique law firms. you see, all lawyers (and especially lawyers in small practices) have a problem – and that’s there are only so many hours in the day. and each hour they’re working on their client work, they’re not marketing their practice – which means fewer clients tomorrow. and if they’re spending time marketing their practice, they’re not doing the client work that makes them money. on top of that, they still have to keep running an office and handling all the administration that goes along with it. so they’re always juggling between “doing the work” and “getting the work” … which keeps their businesses stuck in a rut. but – if they can break free of that tension, they can really grow their firms. how do they do that?that’s where our company comes in – handling their marketing for them. we’ve created a proprietary combination of technology, marketing creative, and business processes that allow lawyers to plug in to our systems very quickly, and stop worrying where their next client will come from. we take that a step further and provide it as a ‘done for you’ system so that our customers don’t need to manage our systems. we manage it for them, so they can get back to practicing law.our customers are great people who are a pleasure to work with – and we become real partners to their business, helping them meet their goals by providing something they want and need. what will you do?
